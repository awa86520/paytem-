In this a PayTM like application that letâ€™s users send money to each other given an initial dummy balance
 


In this  project I  used the following stack-:
1.React in the frontend
2. express in the backend
3. mongoose as input validation 
4. javascript  as the language
5.  tailwind css  
6.monodb  as the database
7.jwt for authentication 
8. cors , Since our frontend and backend will be hosted on separate routes
